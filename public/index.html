<p>
<strong>Grading Policies:</strong> No late assignments will be accepted. It is <i>vastly</i> preferable to
submit a partially complete assignment on time than to turn in a late assignment.
</p><br>

<p>
Similarly, it is vastly more beneficially to turn in a programming or lab assignment that
has 70% of the features fully implemented than to turn in an assignment that has 100%
of the features partially implemented.
</p>

Final course letter grade will be determined using the following scale:
		A			>= 93
		A-			90-92.99			C-		70-72.99
		B+			87-89.99			D+		67-69.99
		B			83-86.99			D		63-66.99
		B-			80-82.99			D-		60-62.99
		C+			77-79.99			F		&lt; 60
		C			73-76.99

<p>
<strong>Course Policies:</strong> Class attendance is required unless otherwise specified. During our
class time we will remain focused on the topics at hand, avoid utilizing phones or email,
and be inclusive of our fellow classmates.
</p><br>

<p>
<strong>Changes to Course Assignments or Grades:</strong> Changes to the course assignments or
grades will be communicated through course lecture and/or Blackboard announcements.

<b>Practices and Policies during the Coronavirus Pandemic</b>
<strong>Responsiveness to Change</strong>
<br><p>
Understanding that the COVID-19 pandemic could influence the course of this
semester, Lewis University will be guided by our Lasallian mission and the 
wellbeing of our community of students, faculty, and staff in respond and adapting to
any sudden changes or circumstances. Based on the guidance of the State of
Illinois and the Centers for Disease Control, it may be necessary to change the
planned modality this course.
<br></p>
<strong>Flexibility, Accommodations, and Student Absences</strong>
<br><p>
Because we are committed to student success, the University community is
committed to academic standards while maintaining flexibility and empathy.
Absences relating to the Coronavirus crisis will be recognized as excused.
Students experiencing disruptions in their lives related to the Coronavirus that
impact class attendance and participation should contact their instructor and/or
college Dean’s Office for assistance. Students directly impacted by Coronavirus
will have the ability to request alternative grading this semester. Requests will be
evaluated on a case by case basis and will require documentation.
<br></p>
<br><p>
Students who require academic accommodations due to disability caused by
COVID-19, or to limit risk of exposure to Coronavirus, can engage in an
interactive process with the Learning Access Coordinator to explore all avenues
for accommodations. Students can contact the Academic Services office at 815-
836-5593 or learningaccess@lewisu.edu to request an appointment.
<br></p>
<strong>Face Coverings, Physical Distancing, and Surface Cleaning</strong>
<br><p>
Face coverings are required in classrooms. Students will be expected to maintain
physical distancing in the classroom (6 ft minimum) and to keep their nose and
mouth covered at all times. Faculty will require students without face covering to
obtain a disposable mask at the nearest University office providing them. While
the University will disinfect classrooms and common spaces throughout the day,
cleaning supplies will be provided in classrooms and offices so that students and
faculty can wipe down work surfaces before class begins.
<br></p>
</pre></li>

<!-- Student info + University Policies -->
<li><pre>
<b>Information for Students</b>
<strong>Requests for Reasonable Accommodations</strong>
<br><p>
Lewis University is committed to providing equal access and opportunity for participation
in all programs, services and activities. If you are a student with a disability who would
like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak with the Learning Access
Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE). Please make
an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing <a href="mailto:learningaccess@lewisu.edu">learningaccess@lewisu.edu</a>. Since
accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is
recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is
not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more
information about academic support services, visit the website at:
<a href="https://www.lewisu.edu/CASE/index.htm">www.lewisu.edu/CASE</a>. 
</br></p>
<br><p>
Lewis University has adopted Blackboard Ally providing alternative formats for files
uploaded by instructors. Students can click the down arrow next to any file and select
Alternative Formats.
</br></p>
<strong>Sanctified Zone</strong>
<br><p>
Guided by its Catholic and Lasallian heritage, Lewis University is firmly committed to
fostering a campus atmosphere that is permeated by its Mission values of Fidelity,
Wisdom, Knowledge, Justice, and Association. Accordingly, we have declared the
University campus to be a Sanctified Zone, a place and a people United in Diversity.
The active promotion of diversity and the opposition to all forms of prejudice and bias are 
a powerful and healing expression of our desire to be Signs of Faith (Signum Fidei) to
each other. To learn more about the Sanctified Zone, please visit:
<a href="http://www.lewisu.edu/sanctifiedzone">http://www.lewisu.edu/sanctifiedzone</a>.
</br></p>
<strong>Academic Integrity</strong>
<br><p>
Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other
forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the
University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and
expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially
considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the
instructor’s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level.
Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the
college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final udecision in all cases
except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the
Provost makes the final decision.
